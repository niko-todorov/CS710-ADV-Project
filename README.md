# Advanced Data Visualization (ADV) Final 
## Niko's CS-710 ADV final project

All of us have been in a lock-down for over a year now. A year of civil rights, police brutality, civil protests and unrests, major election, government insurrection, and finally tapering down of the COVID-19 viral spread. So in a way the virus transcends all these historic events.

I struck out with COVID-19 data from statista.com. Hanna Lu was kind enough to share her dataset from https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv which is linked to https://github.com/owid/
